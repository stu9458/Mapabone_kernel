Subject: [PATCH 11/11] ARM: OMAP: am335x: musb use 250 for power

Issue first noticed by: Randy Rodes <randyrodesnn@gmail.com>
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/beagleboard/qzlwO9ldULE/kXzFAY9rv8cJ

According to the docs, the power value is only 8 bits, to specify 500mA
this needs to be set to a value of 250: value * 2 = XmA
